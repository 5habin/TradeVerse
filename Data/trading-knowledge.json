    {
      "keywords": ["head and shoulders", "head & shoulders", "head and shoulder"],
      "answer": "The Head and Shoulders pattern is a reversal pattern that signals a potential change in the direction of the market trend.\nIt suggests that the trend could be reversing from an uptrend (bullish) to a downtrend (bearish), or from a downtrend to an uptrend (bullish).\nThe pattern consists of three main peaks: a higher peak (head) between two lower peaks (shoulders).\n A neckline is drawn at the support or resistance level connecting the two shoulders.\nWhen the price breaks through the neckline, it confirms the trend reversal, and traders often look for opportunities to enter a trade in the new direction.",

    },
    {
      "keywords": ["double top"],
      "answer": "A double top is a bearish reversal pattern that occurs after an uptrend.\n\nIt forms when the price reaches a high point (the first peak), then pulls back before rising again to a similar high (the second peak).\n\nThe two peaks indicate strong resistance, suggesting that buyers are struggling to push the price higher.\n\nOnce the price fails to break above the resistance level and starts declining, it signals potential weakness in the trend.\n\nA confirmation of the pattern happens when the price breaks below the support level (the low between the two peaks), leading to a downtrend.\n\nTraders often use this pattern to anticipate a trend reversal and may set stop-loss orders above the peaks while targeting lower price levels for profit.",
